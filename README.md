# rename.lua

I like browsing memes on my phone. Issue is that Dank Memer downloads them without any extension, and thus my phone doesn't know what to do with them. This small luvit script is the solution: Read each file, check its file type and rename it accordingly.

Feel free to use, but no stability guarantees. Depends on Luvit 2.x and [voronianski/file-type](https://luvit.io/lit.html#file-type).
